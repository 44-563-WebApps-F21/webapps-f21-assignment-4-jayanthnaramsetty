<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Yes—who has called?</p>

<h5 class="name parker">PARKER.</h5>  <p class="speech">Lord Darlington, my lady.</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Hesitates for a moment_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Show him up—and I’m at
    home to any one who calls.</p>

<h5 class="name parker">PARKER.</h5>  <p class="speech">Yes, my lady.</p>

 <p>[_Exit C._]</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">It’s best for me to see him before to-night.  I’m glad
    he’s come.</p>

<p class="stage_directions">[_Enter_ PARKER _C._]</p>

<h5 class="name parker">PARKER.</h5>  <p class="speech">Lord Darlington,</p>

<p class="stage_directions hover">[_Enter_ LORD DARLINGTON _C._]</p>

<p class="stage_directions hover">[_Exit_ PARKER.]</p>

<h5 class="name ladydarlington">LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">How do you do, Lady Windermere?</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
    hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
    lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.</p>

<h5 class="name ladydarlington">LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">They are quite perfect.</p>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Sees a fan lying on the
    table_.]</p>  <p class="speech">And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
    everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
    present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?</p>

<h5 class="name ladydarlington">LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">No?  Is it really?</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
    life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
    down.</p>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Still arranging flowers_.]</p>

<h5 class="name ladydarlington">LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Sitting down_.]</p>  <p class="speech">I wish I had known it was your
    birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
    front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
    you.</p>

<p class="stage_directions hover">[_A short pause_.]</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
    Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.</p>

<h5 class="name ladydarlington">LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p class="speech">I, Lady Windermere?</p>

<p class="stage_directions hover">[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Put it there, Parker.  That will do.</p>  <p>[_Wipes her hands
    with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]</p>
<p class="speech">Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?</p>

<p class="stage_directions hover">[_Exit_ PARKER _C._]</p>

<h5 class="name ladydarlington">LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]</p>  <p class="speech">I am quite
    miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Sits down at
        table L._]</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="speech">Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
    whole evening.</p>

<h5 class="name ladydarlington">LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Smiling_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
    that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
    things we _can_ pay.</p>

<h5 class="name ladywindermere">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Shaking her head_.]</p>  <p class="speech">No, I am talking very seriously.
    You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
    don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
    he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.</p>
